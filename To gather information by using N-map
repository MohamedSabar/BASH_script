steps:

to scan an ip using N map
frist to Find my IP Address by using this commend

"ip addr"

then with N-map;

using sudo for example:

"sudo nmap -sn 192.168.4.0/24"
The “/24” tells nmap to scan the entire range of this network.

using sudo ensures it can extract as much information as possible. 
sn :option  gives you a neat list of the live IP addresses. 

we can use nmap to scan the ports on each device and tells which ones are open.

for example by "nmap 192.168.4.0/24"
becouse There was a lot of output. we can capture it in a file.
by using:

"nmap 192.168.4.0/24 > nmap-list.txt"

to gather information we can now list the file with less, and search through it 
by using this commend 
"less nmap-list.txt"
